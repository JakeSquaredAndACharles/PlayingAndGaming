# SuperJumpy Man

## Purpose

A simple game that has the user collect stars to add to their overall score in an attempt to get the highest score that they can while avoiding bouncing bombs that are flying around the screen. The user is to use the arrow commands to move the character to achieve the action of getting the stars and to also avoid the bombs.

## API Usage

This game uses two server-side API's which are spotify and Phaser that gives the user access to songs on the left side of the screen by clicking the button. Then Phaser is constantly pulling information to keep up with the players consistent input in the game to play the game. It will pull things such as gravity and player controls.

## Framework and Controls

We made this game by using Phaser, our CSS framework Bulma, a lot of Javascript and Spotify for our second API. The game is played by using the arrows on the keyboard to move left, right, and up to jump to collect all the stars.
